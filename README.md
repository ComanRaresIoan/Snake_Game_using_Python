This code is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Turtle graphics library in Python. Here are the main capabilities and features of the code:

1. Game Setup:
The game window is created using the Turtle graphics library with a black background, a size of 600x600 pixels, and no animation delay (tracer(0)).
The snake's head is represented by a red circle, and the initial position is set at the center of the screen.
The snake food is represented by another red circle, initially placed at coordinates (0, 100).
The initial score is set to 0, and a high score variable is initialized.

2. User Controls:
The snake's direction is controlled by the W, A, S, and D keys (up, left, down, and right, respectively).
Key bindings are set up using the onkeypress method.

3. Game Loop:
The main game loop (while True) is responsible for updating the game state and handling user input.
The wm.update() method updates the screen to reflect the changes.

4. Collision Detection:
The code checks for collisions with the screen borders. If the snake hits the borders, the game resets, and the score is cleared.
If the snake eats the food, a new food location is generated, the snake grows longer, and the score is updated.
Collisions with the snake's own body are checked, and if detected, the game resets.

5. Snake Movement:
The snake moves continuously in the direction specified by the user.
The snake's body consists of segments, and each segment follows the position of the one in front of it.

6. Scoring:
The score is displayed on the screen, and the high score is updated when a new high score is achieved.

7. Speed Adjustment:
The game speed is controlled by the delay variable, which shortens each time the snake eats food, making the game progressively faster.

8. Pen Object:
A Turtle object (pen) is used to display the current score and high score at the top of the game window.
